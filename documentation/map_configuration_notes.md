# High Level
This doc describes the functionality of the map configuration screen.  The map configuration screen is used by the players to set up the initial board state.  The map is the USA, so it's 50 states, each with a certain number of spaces.  Each space will either be left empty, given a mobile home token, or given a mansion token.  

There will be selectable settings to determine how random it is.  These settings will determine the weighting/distribution/restrictions on the placement.  These should be accessible via a dropdown menu at the top.  

# Inputs
There should be various inputs on screen.

1. dropdown for profile
2. checkbox for "Limit FL to 1 of each".  If this is pressed, only one of each property type can be put in Florida at maximum.
3. checkbox for "Limit TX to 1 of each".  If this is pressed, only one of each property type can be put in Texas at maximum.
4. checkbox for "Limit CA to 1 of each".  If this is pressed, only one of each property type can be put in California at maximum.
5. Integer entry for "Number of mansions". This determines how many mansion tokens to assign.  This should default to 10.
6. Integer entry for "Number of mobile homes".  This determines how many mobile home tokens to assign.  This should default to 10.
7. Generate button.  When pressed, the calculation will happen and the output will appear.

# Output
For now, the output will 2 lists:
1. Mobile Home tokens: this is a list of states that got assigned a mobile home token and how many they got assigned.
2. Mansion tokens: this is a list of states that got assigned mansion tokens and how many they got assigned.

# Profiles
There should be a standard file that can be used to generate a profile.  For example, if a new profile called "Coastal Elites", this could be done by generating a .json file that has the following information:

- name ("Coastal Elites")
- state weight, which is a list of the states and an associated weight for mansion and for mobile home (For example in Coastal Elites, Arkansas gets 2.0 for mobile home, 0.25 for mansion.  New York gets 3.0 for mansion, 0.2 for mobile home.) The weight is for each square of a given state; the implication being that California at 10 squares is still 10x more likely to get a mobile home than Oregon at 1 square, given the same weight.
- Acceptable storm difference, which defines how different the total number of mobile homes/mansions can be between storm area sums.  An acceptable difference of 1 means that if Snow has 2 mansions and Hail has 1, Snow will not get another mansion before hail does.  
Description: text to output to the user before clicking generate.

A profile should be able to be added by adding the proper profile .md file to a folder in the file, then rebuilding.

# Parameters
Each state has a certain number of spaces that a token could be assigned to.  Each state also has a storm type.  Texas is Tornado AND Hurricane.  California is Fire AND Earthquake.  For both of these, a mobile home or mansion on a square would count as one in EACH of their storm types for the purposes of acceptable storm difference.  Hurricane (Florida) is technically a separate storm type, but for the purposes of assigning these tokens, it is considered part of Hurricane.
