This is the four ideas for tracker tab layouts/button flows.

## Idea 1

The tracker screen will still have the banner at the top saying "Policy Tracker".  It will still have the total premium and total victory points under that.  

Below that will be 8 icons: In order left to right then top to bottom, Earthquake, Snow, Hurricane/Hurricane Florida, Fire, Hail, Tornado, Flood, California/Texas.  Clicking any of these brings up a popup that shows the policy types (Mobile home, house, and mansion), along with a plus/minus to add or subtract policies.

If the hurricane one is clicked, this is the same except next to the symbol, there's a toggle for Hurricane-Other (shown as a hurricane symbol) and Hurricane-Florida (Shown as a florida state outline).

If the California/Texas one is clicked, it's the same except at the top there's a toggle for CA/TX, each as it's state outline.  Clicking a plus adds a policy to each relevant storm type (since both of those states are dual policy states-CA with fire/eq, tx with hurricane/tornado).  clicking minus subtracts a policy from each.  

For all except CA/TX, on the individual popup, it should show how much of each policy type in that storm you have.  On the main screen, it would be great if in the corner of each storm's picture, it showed the number of each policy that you have (not for CA/TX).
